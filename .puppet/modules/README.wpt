This module is simply a clone of the Example42 apache puppet module, to allow managing multiple Apache instances, since puppet enforces only a single instance of a class. The better way to do this would be to refactor the Example42 module to use a define rather than a class.

To update (on neccessary when updating the apache module) it run the following:
cd ~/.puppet/modules
rm -rf wpt
module_clone.sh -m apache -n wpt
