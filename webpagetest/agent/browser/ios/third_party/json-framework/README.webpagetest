Description:
A json parser for Mac and iPhone.

Local Modifications:

Fixed up issues with errors pointer not being checked before assigned.
Added some parens to get rid of assignment used as a truth value warning.
+[NSDecimalNumber decimalNumberWithString:] honors user's locale, force the
  en_US locale so parsing always handles ".".
Make kEscapeChars a non mutable character set just to be safe if more then one
  SBJSON object is used at a time.

* Added i386 as a valid architecture.

Made Objects allow their keys to not be explicitly wrapped in quotes.
For example {g:501} is now acceptable instead of forcing {"g":501}.
