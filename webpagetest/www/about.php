                <br><p>WebPagetest is an open source project that is primarily being developed and supported by Google as part of our efforts 
                to <a href="http://developers.google.com/speed">make the web faster</a>.</p>
                <p>WebPagetest is a tool that was originally developed by <a href="http://dev.aol.com/">AOL</a> for use internally and was open-sourced in 2008 
                under a BSD license.  The platform is under active development on <a href="https://github.com/WPO-Foundation/webpagetest">GitHub</a> and 
                is also packaged up periodically and available for <a href="http://www.webpagetest.org/forums/forumdisplay.php?fid=12">download</a> if you would like to run your own 
                instance.</p>
                <p>The online version at <a href="http://www.webpagetest.org/">www.webpagetest.org</a> is run by 
                the <a href="http://www.wpofoundation.org">WPO Foundation</a> for the benefit of the performance community 
                with several companies and individuals providing the testing infrastructure around the globe.</p>
                <p>In exchange for running a testing location, partners get their logo associated with the location and a banner on the site. 
                <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/webpagetest.org/docs/other-resources/hosting-a-test-location">Hosting a test location</a> is open to anyone who is interested and 
                does not constitute an endorsement of the services offered by the partner (however, I think you will find that the partners providing test locations 
                tend to be very involved in the web performance community).</p>
                <p>If you are having any problems of just have questions about the site, please feel free to <a href="mailto:pmeenan@webpagetest.org">contact me</a>.</p>
