1.0.0 Upgrade

Unfortunately many changes have been made and there is no easy upgrade path for existing users to move from pre 1.0.0
releases to 1.0.0. I apologize for this and will try to keep this issue tied only to major releases. I will always
try to provide a convenient point release upgrade path for each new point release.

UPDATE: 2011/03/18 Release 1.0

You may be able to upgrade to 1.0 by executing /GenerateTables.php and then /FixFolders.php
This should update the db to support the new functionality. If not, a new install may be required.
