The DeviceSupport directory contains Xcode iOS Developer Disk Images, which are required
by the idevice-app-runner to launch our openURL app.

These images are only required if you're using the openURL app, and only if you want to
avoid an Xcode runtime dependency (e.g. on Linux).


The DeviceSupport directory should contain all "*.dmg*" files, e.g.:

  ./DeviceSupport/5.0/DeveloperDiskImage.dmg
  ./DeviceSupport/5.0/DeveloperDiskImage.dmg.signature
  ./DeviceSupport/6.0/DeveloperDiskImage.dmg
  ./DeviceSupport/6.0/DeveloperDiskImage.dmg.signature
  ...

This can be a symlink:

  ln -s \
    /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/DeviceSupport

or a full copy:

  rsync -a SOME_DIRECTORY/DeviceSupport --include="DeveloperDiskImage.dmg*" .
